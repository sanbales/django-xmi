# django-xmi
A Django app that creates Django models from an XMI spec.

The basic gist is to be able to make Django models from XML Metadata Interchange specifications so UML, SysML, and other languages can be represented in a Django model.

This is not intended to be a perfect translator, and there are many things it does not handle well, but it can hopefully help someone start the process.  It pretty much guaranteed that any code autogenerated with this tool will require extensive manual correction.

# Note
This project is an experiment and it has issues that need to be resolved.  Hopefully you find some value in the patterns and general approach.  Contributions are welcome, but there are some intrinsic challenges in scaling this to represent real-world UML and SysML models that may not be solvable.
